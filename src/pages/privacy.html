            In addition to this Privacy Policy, Astro also has Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Astro Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Astro
            website and services. The laws of California and the laws of the
            United States apply. If you are a resident of EU/EEA, the European
            Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (also referred to
            as Model Contracts) apply to Trans-Atlantic data transfers.
          </p>

          <h5>General Information</h5>
          <p>
            We collect very limited personally identifiable information
            described below (the “data”) from GitHub and of those who
            communicate with us directly via e-mail, aggregate information on
            what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by
            the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations).
            The information we collect is used to provide our services, and to
            improve the quality of our services, and is not shared with or sold
            to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide
            products or services you’ve requested when we have your permission,
            or under the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <p>
            It is necessary to share information in order to investigate,
            prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
            fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety
            of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise
            required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We transfer information about you if Astro is acquired by or merged
            with another company. In this event, Astro will notify you before
            information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
            different privacy policy.
          </p>

          <h5>Information Gathering and Usage</h5>
          <p>
            Astro uses collected information for the following general purposes:
            products and services provision, billing, identification and
            authentication through GitHub, Bitbucket, services improvement,
            contact, and research. Astro uses personally identifiable
            information on billing address and/or payment information only for
            the sole purpose of payment processing for Astro services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment processing services enable us to process payments by credit
            card, bank transfer or other means. To ensure greater security, we
            share only the information necessary to execute the transaction with
            the financial intermediaries handling the transaction. Some of these
            services may also enable the sending of timed messages to our
            customer, such as emails containing invoices or notifications
            concerning the payment.
          </p>

          <h5>Cookies</h5>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an
            anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a
            web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can control how websites use cookies by configuring the privacy
            settings within your browser. Note that if you disable cookies
            entirely, Astro websites and applications may not function properly.
          </p>

          <h5>Data Storage</h5>
          <p>
            Astro uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
            necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
            technology required to run Astro. Astro’s third-party vendors and
            hosting partners adhere to the European Commission-approved Standard
            Contractual Clauses (also referred to as Model Contracts).
          </p>

          <h5>Data Retention and Deletion</h5>
          <p>
            Data is kept for the time necessary to provide the products or
            services requested by the customer. We keep some of your personal
            data for as long as you are a user of the Astro Service. When you
            delete your account, we will delete your personal data and it will
            expire from backups; unless we are legally allowed or required to
            maintain certain personal data, including situations under the
            applicable laws to reveal personal data upon reasonable request of
            public authorities.
          </p>

          <h5>Rights of Data Subjects</h5>
          <p>
            Data subject (customer) can always request Astro to allow access and
            correction, supplement or update of data. Subject to a reasonable
            request of a data subject, Astro will remove data pertaining to a
            data subject unless applicable laws impose a duty to retain data for
            certain time or identification, location and deletion of data
            imposes a disproportionate financial burden upon Astro. Any requests
            for access, correction or deletion of data should be directed to
            Astro by sending an email to privacy@astro.build.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may be aware that a European Union law, called the General Data
            Protection Regulation or “GDPR” gives certain rights to individuals
            in relation to their personal data. In order to enable you to
            exercise these rights with ease in relation to how Astro uses your
            personal data, we provide you with access to the following settings
            via your Account Settings page:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Remove Account - allows you to delete your account and associated
              personal data; and,
            </li>
            <li>
              Notifications - allows you to manage communications you receive
              from Astro.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As a user you may also request a copy of your data and that your
            data be updated, deleted, restricted or moved to another
            organization.
          </p>

          <h5>We may share your information with</h5>
          <p>
            We want to process as little personal information as possible when
            you use our website. That’s why we’ve chosen Fathom Analytics for
            our website analytics, which doesn’t use cookies and complies with
            the GDPR, ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA and CCPA. Using this
            privacy-friendly website analytics software, your IP address is only
            briefly processed, and we (running this website) have no way of
            identifying you. As per the CCPA, your personal information is
            de-identified. You can read more about this on Fathom Analytics’
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of us using this software is to understand our website
            traffic in the most privacy-friendly way possible so that we can
            continually improve our website and business. The lawful basis as
            per the GDPR is “Article 6(1)(f); where our legitimate interests are
            to improve our website and business continually.” As per the
            explanation, no personal data is stored over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you choose to submit feedback on the docs site, we store your
            message using the Feedback Fish service. This enables us to gather
            helpful feedback and improve our documentation.
          </p>

          <h5>Security</h5>
          <p>
            We understand that the security of your data is important. We
            provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security
            controls to protect your personal information from unauthorized
            access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction.
            However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100%
            effective and Astro cannot ensure or warrant the security of your
            data.
          </p>

          <h5>Links</h5>
          <p>
            We may display content that links to third-party websites. We cannot
            control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices
            and content. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link,
            please understand that you are leaving the Astro website and any
